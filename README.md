This compendium full of insane ramblings about of algorithms, data structures, and programming techniques is meant to educate programmers on how they work by providing intuitive and simple-ish explanations. The examples presented in the compendium are mainly based on LeetCode problems, but there are also a few examples that I thought would be interesting to include.

# Languages Used

- C++ (C++17 standard)
- Python (Python 3.12)

*More languages will be added in future updates*
