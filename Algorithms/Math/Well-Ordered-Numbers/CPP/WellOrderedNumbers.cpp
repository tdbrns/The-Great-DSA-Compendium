Algorithm:          Well-Ordered Numbers

Task:               A well-ordered number is a number with digits that are in strictly increasing order from left to right (e.g., 123, 
                    124, 3589, etc.). Given a number of digits n, find all well-ordered number with n digits. n can be any number from
                    1 to 9.

Solution:           Use a recursive algorithm to print out each possible well-ordered number with n digits. 
                    A well-ordered number is created with the following constraint:
                        Let a = value of the current digit
                        Let b = value of the digit to the left of the current digit
                        â€¢ 0 < b < a <= 9
                    The algorithm works by recursively increasing the number of digits of a well-ordered number until there are n digits
                    and then iterativelyprinting the well-ordered number with digits 1 to 9 in its appropriate place according the the
                    constraint mentioned above.

Time complexity:    O(N * 2^N)
                        N = number of digits n
                        2^N = number of n-digit numbers to be generated

Space complexity:   O(N)
                        N = maximum depth of the recursive call stack

Auxiliary space:    O(N)
                        N = maximum depth of the recursive call stack
